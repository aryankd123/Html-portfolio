<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
Hi! I’m Aryan, an enthusiastic and curious learner currently studying at IIT Guwahati.
<br> My interests lie in software development, robotics, and competitive programming, and I’m passionate about creating impactful tech-driven solutions.
</p>
<p>I’m actively involved in competitive programming on platforms like Codeforces, where I enjoy honing my algorithmic skills. At IITG, I lead the Mitra project under 4i Labs, an initiative focused on developing an intelligent agricultural bot. My work involves overseeing design, integration, and testing — blending engineering with practical problem-solving.

Whether I’m building efficient code, leading tech teams, or designing smart machines, I thrive at the intersection of logic, innovation, and purpose.</p>
